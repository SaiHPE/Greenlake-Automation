# Get a history resource

Retrieve a single history entry for a schedule resource.


URI PATH PREFIX RENAME

This API now supports the URI path prefix /compute-ops-mgmt which used to be /compute-ops. The /compute-ops prefix is deprecated
and might become unresponsive after Tuesday, April 1, 2025. The Guide
provides more information about this change.

Endpoint: GET /compute-ops-mgmt/v1beta2/schedules/{id}/history/{history-id}
Version: latest
Security: Bearer

## Path parameters:

  - `id` (string, required)
    Schedule ID

  - `history-id` (string, required)
    History ID

## Query parameters:

  - `select` (string)
    Limit the properties of the resource returned in a successful response.  When applied to
write operations, select controls only the properties that are returned, not which
properties are operated on. All properties are returned if the select parameter is omitted.

The value of the select query parameter is a comma separated list of properties to include
in the response. Nested properties use / as a separator, e.g. select=interfaces/name
selects the name property within an interfaces object.

For operations that return paginated collections, select operates on the resources in
the collection. The pagination properties like count and items are always included even
when select is specified.

## Header parameters:

  - `Tenant-Acid` (string)
    Tenant-Acid header can be used by an MSP workspace to make API calls on behalf of their tenant by specifying the tenant's application customer ID.

In order to make such an API call, the Bearer token must belong to an MSP workspace and this header value must be the application customer ID of a tenant within the MSP workspace. Use the /compute-ops-mgmt/v1beta1/accounts API to determine the application customer IDs for your tenant accounts.
